A personal portfolio site built from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no nonsense.
Just clean design, smooth animations, and a layout that actually feels like you.

💡 What’s Inside

⚙️ Fully responsive design that adapts to any screen

🪄 Smooth transitions & subtle effects (because we hate boring sites)

📂 Sections for About, Skills, Projects, and Contact

💬 Clean, minimal UI that keeps focus on you — the creator

☁️ Deploy-ready for GitHub Pages or any hosting platform

🧠 Why I Built It

This portfolio isn’t just another “assignment site.”
It’s a digital identity — a place to showcase projects, share ideas, and experiment with design & logic in pure frontend.
